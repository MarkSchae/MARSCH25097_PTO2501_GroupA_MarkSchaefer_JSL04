// Starting the jsl 4 js script

/* Workflow for this code: 
    Create the html DOM for each object dynamically
    Sort each object by status
    Add the styling
    Create a button to edit each task
    Create a button to save the edits
    Create a function to save the changes to the objects using the id as a identifier
*/

// Saving the edits to the innerhtml, and then the database later in the course
// Make a save button, when clicked update the html with the inputs from the user, just get it from the input field id, also need to use the object id
// Function to show the detail view when clicking on one of the tasks and code to exit the detailed view
// Add a onclick function to each div and display the detailed information on a styled card according to the figma

// Function to allow the user to modify the description etc of the task

// Status drop down menu to change the status

// Going to need to have some code that updates the array and the html when changes are made, maybe a save changes button

/*
    Thoughts for the upcoming functionality:
        Thinking about writing the code to update the objetcs when a user edits their tasks
        Need to update the object itself
        Need to update the innerhtml so it changes with and without the reload
        Need to change the column that the task is in
        Need to make sure that the edited tasks are created dynamicaly into the correct columns etc
        Create a save changes button
        How to increment id when some tasks are deleted/other scenarios
